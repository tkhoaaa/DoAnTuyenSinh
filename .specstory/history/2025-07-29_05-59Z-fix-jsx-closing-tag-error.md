# Fix JSX closing tag error (2025-07-29 05:59Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
JSX element 'AuthContext.Provider' has no corresponding closing tag.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, I can see the issue. The JSX syntax is malformed with incorrect spacing and formatting. The problem is on lines 103-106 where the JSX tags are broken across lines incorrectly.

I will fix the malformed JSX syntax by properly formatting the AuthContext.Provider component with correct spacing and closing tags.

  };

The error has been resolved! The issue was with the malformed JSX syntax where the tags were broken across lines incorrectly. I fixed it by:

1. Properly formatting the opening `<AuthContext.Provider>` tag on a single line
2. Adding proper spacing and indentation for the `{children}` content
3. Correctly closing the tag with `</AuthContext.Provider>`

The JSX is now properly formatted and should compile without errors.
